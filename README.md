# StoryBook intro

This is my first play with [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org).

It looks like a really great solution for working on a team. While the *functionality* of components can be tested with unit testing, the actual aesthetics of UI components should be tested by humans.

StoryBook could be a good way to build a documented UI library, have everything in one place, and test these components with different props, in different environments, with edge cases, and in isolation easily.
